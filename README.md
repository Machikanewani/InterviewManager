* After filling up company name and my page's link, let's create first part of this interview with its name, date/deadline and some memo if you want. 
Of course you can quit to list page without creating any part of this interview.

just clicking once.

* By clicking `Edit` button, you can literally change everything you have inputed before (be aware that company name and block name should not be empty!).   
 Besides, you can choose to delete a single part of interview or just give up edition with `Cancel` button. Every buttons except for `Edit` you click would make your changes disappear, so please click somthing with much attention.
